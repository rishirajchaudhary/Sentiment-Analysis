# Sentiment-Analysis
This readme explains how to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to the Russia-Ukraine war using Python and the NLTK library. Sentiment analysis can help to understand public opinion on the conflict. It covers data collection, data preprocessing, and sentiment analysis using the VADER sentiment analyzer.

Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing technique that involves analyzing text data to determine the overall sentiment or emotional tone of the content. In the context of the Russia-Ukraine war, sentiment analysis can help to understand the attitudes and opinions of people towards the conflict.
This repository contains code for performing sentiment analysis on tweets related to the Russia-Ukraine war using Python and the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) library.
Sentiment analysis can provide valuable insights into public opinion on the conflict, and can be useful for researchers and policymakers interested in understanding the attitudes and emotions of people towards the war.

# Getting Started
To get started with the sentiment analysis, you will need to have Python 3 and the NLTK library installed. You will also need to download the necessary NLTK corpora and resources.

# Data Collection
To perform sentiment analysis, you will need to collect data on the Russia-Ukraine war. One way to do this is by using the Twitter API to retrieve tweets that contain relevant keywords or hashtags. You can use the Tweepy library to interact with the Twitter API.

# Data Preprocessing
After collecting the data, you will need to preprocess it before performing sentiment analysis. This involves cleaning the text data by removing any URLs, mentions, hashtags, punctuation, and stop words. You can also normalize the text data by converting it to lowercase.

# Sentiment Analysis
Once you have preprocessed the data, you can use the NLTK library to perform sentiment analysis. NLTK provides a built-in sentiment analyzer called VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner), which is capable of analyzing sentiment in social media text.

To use VADER, you will need to create an instance of the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class and apply it to each tweet in your dataset. The SentimentIntensityAnalyzer class returns a dictionary of scores that indicate the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment of the text.

# Conclusion
Sentiment analysis is a valuable tool for understanding public opinion on the Russia-Ukraine war. By collecting and analyzing data on social media, researchers and policymakers can gain insights into the attitudes and emotions of people towards the conflict.
